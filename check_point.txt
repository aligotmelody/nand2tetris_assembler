next step: figure a way to have each of the c instruction commands have the correct key [dest, comp, jmp]


checkpoint

 “””
Cinst_dest_rest = (tok.value.split("="))
      print(Cinst_dest_rest)
      #Cinst_cm_jm = Cinst_dest_rest.split(";")
      dest = Cinst_dest_rest[0]
      #cmp  = Cinst_cm_jm[0]
     # jmp  = Cinst_cm_jm[1]
      N_Cinstruction = {
        "dest": dest ,
        #"cmp" : cmp ,
        #"jmp" : jmp ,
“””
have the c instruction broken down to the needed commands 

first of all do the A instruction 
second of all do the the most common c instruction [AD=D-1]


there seems to be an issue with the regex #double check#
COMMENTS regex IS WORKING
the Ainstruction regex is working
the label regex is working
the Cinstruction is working fine

###don't forget to separate the Ainstruction into 2 categories Variables and numbers [addresses]
