next step: figure a way to have each of the c instruction commands have the correct key [dest, comp, jmp]


checkpoint

first of all do the A instruction 
second of all do the the most common c instruction [AD=D-1]


there seems to be an issue with the regex #double check#
COMMENTS regex IS WORKING
the Ainstruction regex is working
the label regex is working
the Cinstruction is working fine

###don't forget to separate the Ainstruction into 2 categories Variables and numbers [addresses]


##########you need to review the regex according to the colored output######

also get to the root of why the commands are breaking to different lines example:
#the command:
-	D;JGT 

#became:
-	D
-	;JGT
