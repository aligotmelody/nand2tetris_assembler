next step: figure a way to have each of the c instruction commands have the correct key [dest, comp, jmp]


checkpoint

first of all do the A instruction 
second of all do the the most common c instruction [AD=D-1]


###don't forget to separate the Ainstruction into 2 categories Variables and numbers [addresses]


try and see if the commands are coming at one piece if that's the case then no need to see why are they breaking
starting with 
#Ainst_Vars
#labels
#Ainst_addresses
#Cinstru


also get to the root of why the commands are breaking to different lines example:
#the command:
-	D;JGT 

#became:
-	D
-	;JGT


review and work on the new regex [ on notion ]
